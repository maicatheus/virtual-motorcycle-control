# Virtual Motorcycle Controller

## Description
The Virtual Motorcycle Controller is an innovative project that utilizes computer vision and gamepad control to simulate the experience of riding a motorcycle. Using the OpenCV library for image processing and MediaPipe for pose detection, this project captures user movements through a webcam and translates them into control commands in a virtual environment.

## Features
- Real-time pose detection
- Gesture-based acceleration and braking control
- Simulation of steering through body tilt

## How the Virtual Motorcycle Controller Works

### Acceleration and Braking Control
The Virtual Motorcycle Controller offers an interactive and intuitive virtual motorcycle riding experience. Acceleration and braking control are performed through body gestures detected by the webcam. Here's how it works:

- Acceleration: To increase the speed of the virtual motorcycle, you must lean your body downward. This is detected by the camera and interpreted by the software as an acceleration command. The more you lean, the higher the acceleration.

- Braking: To reduce speed or stop the virtual motorcycle, you need to lean your body upward. Similar to acceleration, the software measures the degree of your body tilt and applies braking proportionally.

### Detection and Processing
The program uses the MediaPipe library for real-time pose detection and OpenCV for image processing. This allows it to accurately identify the position and movement of your body in front of the webcam. Through this recognition, the software can interpret your movements and translate them into control commands in the game.

### Visual Feedback
During usage, the software provides visual feedback on the screen. You will see your image captured by the webcam with markings for detected poses and indicator bars for acceleration and braking, giving a clear idea of how your movements are being translated into actions in the virtual environment.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the area in front of the webcam is clear and well-lit for efficient pose detection.
- It is recommended to have an adaptation period to get used to the gestures required to control the virtual motorcycle.

## Prerequisites
To run the Virtual Motorcycle Controller, you will need to install some dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- MediaPipe
- vgamepad
